What Happen, If Constructor Is Defined As Private Or Protected?

=>In PHP, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. If a constructor is defined as private or protected, it means that it can only be accessed from within the class itself or its subclasses, respectively.

If the constructor is defined as private, it means that it can only be accessed within the same class and not from any other class or object. This can be useful when you want to prevent instances of the class from being created directly from outside the class. In this case, the only way to create an instance of the class would be to use a static method or a factory method that can access the private constructor.

If the constructor is defined as protected, it means that it can only be accessed from within the same class or its subclasses. This can be useful when you want to allow subclasses to have access to the constructor, but not other classes or objects.

In both cases, the constructor can be used to initialize object properties or perform any other necessary setup when an object is created. However, the visibility of the constructor determines who can call it and under what circumstances
