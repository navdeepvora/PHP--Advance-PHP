â€¢ What are PHP Magic Methods/Functions?

=>In PHP, magic methods (also known as magic functions) are special methods that start with the prefix "__" (double underscore) and are used to handle certain events or operations that occur within an object.

Magic methods are automatically called by PHP when certain conditions are met, such as when a property is accessed or when a method is called on an object. They allow you to define custom behavior for these operations, which can be useful for tasks like validation, error handling, or customizing the behavior of a class.

Some of the most commonly used magic methods in PHP include:

__construct(): This is the constructor method, which is automatically called when an object is created from a class.
__destruct(): This is the destructor method, which is automatically called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope.
__get(): This is called when an inaccessible property is accessed, and allows you to define custom behavior for retrieving the value of the property.
__set(): This is called when a value is assigned to an inaccessible property, and allows you to define custom behavior for setting the value of the property.
__call(): This is called when an inaccessible method is called, and allows you to define custom behavior for handling the method call.
There are several other magic methods in PHP, each with their own specific use cases. By implementing magic methods in your classes, you can make your code more flexible and customizable.
