editing mode
=>In PHP, there is no specific "editing mode" as PHP is a scripting language that runs on the server side. However, there are a number of tools and techniques that can be used to edit and manipulate PHP code.

One way to edit PHP code is to use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports PHP syntax highlighting and code completion. Some popular text editors for PHP development include Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, while popular IDEs include PHPStorm, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

Another way to manipulate PHP code is to use built-in functions and operators to modify variables and values within the code. For example, the concatenation operator (.) can be used to combine strings, while the assignment operator (=) can be used to change the value of a variable.

Overall, there are many different ways to edit and manipulate PHP code, depending on the specific task at hand and the tools and techniques available.
